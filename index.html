<h1>Dave's World</h1>
<h5>Living that 68k powered dream.</h5>
<p>Dave is back, baby.</p>
<p>This is the home of Dave on the internet. Your source for all things Dave. Following me on social media? Great. But don't expect to see anything there. All the good Dave is right here. Straight from the source. Freshly squeezed Dave. Unfiltered. No algorithms... except when I'm talking about programming.</p>
<p>This is a temporary placeholder site while I figure out a long term plan for my internet presence.</p>
